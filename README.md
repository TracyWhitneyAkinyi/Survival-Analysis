# Survival-Analysis
Survival analysis using the Haberman's dataset 

Survival analysis also known as time-to-event analysis is a branch in statistics whose approach is used to investigate the time it takes for an event to occur. Survival analysis is used in various fields such as:

- Medical: Understanding patientâ€™s survival when diagnosed with a deadly disease.
- Industry:Failure- time analysis of a product.
- Human resource: When an employee would leave a company (churn).
There are various methods used in survival analysis to understand the time to event data. Here, we are going to learn, the following types of models and try to understand their mechanism in time to event analysis.

## Aim of the project
The aim of the project is to predict whether the patient will survive after 5 years or not depending on the patient's age, year of operation and positive auxilliary nodes.
